ATL based library written with vb6 using windows API's.

Including very strong methods such as concurrent execution in most of classes ,wide graphics engine ,
And also data streaming and an internal actions called Texing!

MintAPI allows you to do more works using less statements which can write in only single lines.

MintAPI provides under LGPLv3 license ,you can use it freely.

I recommend you to use it ,it's very nice and cute.
