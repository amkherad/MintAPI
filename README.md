# MintAPI
This was the first framework I've made, despite the fact that I was never finished, it helped me a lot to boost my learning speed and pushed my knowledge a lot.
It started with a simple class library for applications that I've been developing but after some challenges in VB6' runtime I had to do some "HACKS" to get around
the limitations of the runtime (like multithreading). In that time I already knew assembly language and [I started utilizing assembly](https://github.com/amkherad/MintAPI/blob/27c2b1ab09c7863cfc7898d3dc0768ce5306018b/MintAPI/src/MintAPI/modules/mint_assemblies.bas#L212) in the framework! (with some "hacks" of course)
I wasn't a fluent english speaker (and I'm still not) so there's a lot of bad english in the code!

Also [VBCorLib](https://github.com/kellyethridge/VBCorLib) helped me a lot to findout how to implement some COM/OLE features in VB6.

Last time I was developing the framework (it was around 2010) I was trying to implement [delegation in VB6](https://github.com/amkherad/MintAPI/blob/27c2b1ab09c7863cfc7898d3dc0768ce5306018b/MintAPI/src/MintAPI/Delegation/Method.cls#L205).

Putting this on github just for my collection.
